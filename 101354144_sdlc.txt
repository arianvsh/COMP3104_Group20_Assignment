About the importance of learning DevOps:

The learning of DevOps helps in enhancing the software development life cycle
through cutting the development time from months or weeks to days or even
hours. Application changes are done faster and frequently reach the production
environment. Thus, accelerates the prototype development cycle and reduces
deployment time.
