hours. Application changes are done faster and frequently reach the production
environment. Thus, accelerates the prototype development cycle and reduces
deployment time.

organization. It can increase your career growth. You can become a Release
Manager, Project Manager, Automation Architect or even a DevOps Evangelist.
