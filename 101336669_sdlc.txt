Learning DevOps is significant because it is a software development and operations 
methodology that facilitates quicker creation of new products and simpler 
maintenance of the deployed applications. A "systems thinking" approach is promoted 
by DevOps. Giving everyone the perspective to see how their own activities will affect
 a project is what this really entails. Everyone is encouraged to perceive things
  holistically and to recognize the worth of their own and one another's contributions.
