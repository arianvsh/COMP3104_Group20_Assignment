Learning DevOps is crucial as it is a software development and operations 
methodology that facilitates quicker creation of new products and simpler 
maintenance of the deployed applications. A systems thinking approach is promoted 
by DevOps. Giving everyone the perspective to see how their own activities will affect
 a project is what DevOps really entails. Everyone is encouraged to see things
  holistically and to recognize the worth of not just their own but everyone else's contributions.
